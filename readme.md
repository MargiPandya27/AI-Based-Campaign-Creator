## Objective

This project demonstrates a minimal viable product (MVP) for automating the creation of digital ad campaigns using a Large Language Model (LLM) and deploying them on platforms like Meta, TikTok, or LinkedIn. The tool takes a structured campaign brief and optionally a PDF input, and generates ad copy and targeting suggestions using prompt-engineered LLM responses.

### Core Modules

1. **PDF Text Extraction**  
   Utilizes `PyMuPDF` for multi-page PDF parsing and conversion to usable plain text.

2. **LLM-Powered Ad Generator**  
   Uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash via the Generative AI API to generate structured campaign content with tailored prompt engineering for LinkedIn.

3. **Campaign Deployment (Prototype)**  
   Placeholder logic that simulates campaign submission. Modularized to integrate Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok Ads APIs in production.

## LLM Model Selection

| Model         | Pros                                             | Cons                                 | Reason for Not Choosing          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Gemini 1.5 Flash** | Fast, structured output, stable formatting | API limits, Easy to deploy          | ✅ Chosen for MVP                 |
| LLaMA 2        | Open-source, local control                      | Requires GPU, setup-heavy            | Not practical for quick MVP      |
| Mistral        | Lightweight, open license                       | Lower instruction-following ability  | Less robust for prompt structure |
| Claude         | Strong reasoning and summarization              | Inconsistent formatting, slower      | Good alternative, not ideal here |
| GPT-4          | Powerful and accurate                           | Expensive, slow                      | Overkill for MVP, high latency   |

**Gemini 1.5 Flash** was chosen for its optimal trade-off between inference speed, formatting reliability, and ease of integration for a structured prompt environment.

## Getting Started & Running the Code

### 1. Setup Environment

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atomicads-ai-engineer-assignment-margi.git
cd atomicads-ai-engineer-assignment-margi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Access
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Google Generative AI API key:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_genai_api_key_here
```

⚠️ You need access to Google’s Gemini Generative AI API for this to work.

### 3. How to Set Up the Workflow in Zapier

1. Go to the [Zapier Dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard)
2. Click on **"Create Zap"**

#### Step 1: Set Up Trigger

- **App**: Webhooks by Zapier  
- **Trigger Event**: `Catch Hook`  
- Zapier will generate a custom webhook URL. Use it in your Python script to POST the generated LinkedIn ad content.


### 4. Run the Application
Run the python app.py to generate an ad campaign:

```bash
python app.py
```
